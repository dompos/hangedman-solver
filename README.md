# Hanged Man Game Solver  
A simple script written in TypeScript that solves the Italian 'impiccato' game.  

## How to use  
1. Set `wordLen` to the length of the word you want to find.  
2. Set `wordToFindTemplate` with a number of underscores (`_`) equal to the length of the word you want to find.  
3. The script will print the letters you need to guess in descending order and provide a list of possible answers.  
4. Modify `wordToFindTemplate` and rerun the script for more precise answers.
